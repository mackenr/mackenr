### Welcome to my GitHub. My name is Richard &mdash; my friends call me Rich :)

### Bio:

A proud Naval Special Operations Veteran (Diver) with an insatiable intellectual curiosity, I add value through my diverse background in engineering and risk assessment. My analytical proclivities, degree in computer engineering (AA) and certification in data science guide me towards objective truth &mdash; verifiable by data
 
I am a strong proponent of the ubiquitous utility of data disciplines. It is the convergence of my military and academic histories, which are the intrinsic drivers of my passion for using data and mathematical tools to optimize risk, guide decisions and solve complex problems.

### Data Related Interests:
- #### Optimization
  - The concept of optimization is a philosophical motivation for my interest in data science and coding in general.
  - Metaheuristics like Ant colony optimization and Genetic algorithms are fascinating to me.
- #### Data Wrangling
  - Web Scraping
  - Regex
  - Cleaning
  > Overall I enjoy finding the patterns and solving the problems involved in acquiring and cleaning data. This seems to be the most interesting and useful part as the further steps in the data pipeline seem to be far relatively generalizable from that point on.
 
- #### Generalizable pipelines
  - After Data is properly wrangled, I enjoy creating and making subtle tweaks to the pipeline. The most immediately rewarding process is seeing your model's results improve.

> Ultimately, I am interested in creating the most efficient systems possible subject to dynamic real world constraints, in order to provide the most objective guidance for decision-making.
